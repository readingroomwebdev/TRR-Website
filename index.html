                <h1>Who are we?</h1>
                <p>The Reading Room is an Independent Record Label founded by Brandon Dcruz in 2017. We promote alternative, rock, folk, jazz, hip-hop, electronic, and anything in between. We work directly with the artists to create original pieces as a team; pieces that we can be proud of. The Reading Room is a home for stories, people, and music. Our sound is coming from the corner of a local coffee shop, over small tabletops and underpaid waitresses. It weaves between conversations about skyscrapers and makes people smile. We hope you enjoy our art as much as we do.</p>
                <p>We're always looking for new talent. The Reading Room was designed for new artists who want to turn their guitar chord progressions or scattered poetry into something more. </p>
                <p>Please send demos to Brandon at readingroommusic@gmail.com. Include 2 or 3 original pieces (covers can wait). SoundCloud links work best. Also, tell us about yourself! The Reading Room is a close-knit family of individuals and weirdos, and we want to know all about who you are. We will get back to you as soon as we can. </p>
                <p>If you're interested in joining our team as a visual artist, graphic designer, or team lead, please email Brandon at bvd5889@rit.edu with a few paragraphs of what you want to do. We are a small, Rochester-based organization led by a college student with a dream, any help would be greatly appreciated.</p>
